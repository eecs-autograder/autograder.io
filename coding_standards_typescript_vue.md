# Typescript/Vue Coding Standards
Any style conventions described in a repository's README take precedence over this document.
We are in the process of adding Prettier to the ag-website-vue repository. Please refer
to that repo's README for when and how to apply Prettier to changes you contribute.

Typescript and Vue projects should use TSLint/ESLint to enforce these standards where possible.
Extisting projects already have this set up as part of the continuous integration checks.

## A Note on Auto-Formatters
When contributing, please do NOT run any auto-formatting tools on the source code. Since such
tools are ofter highly opinionated, they can clutter pull requests with formatting-only changes
and make it harder for me to review your code.

If this document is agnostic on a particular element style, follow the convention used in the
file you are editing. If you're writing a new file, try to follow the convention used in another
similar file.

## Indentation
- Indent using 2 spaces in .vue, .html, and .yml/.yaml files.
- Indent using 4 spaces in .json, .js, .ts, and .md files.
    - Note that npm will overwrite the formatting to 2 spaces on package.json when you use `npm install --save <package>`. Therefore, we will indent using 2 spaces in package.json.
- Since .vue files have typescript, html, and css in them, we will use 2 spaces for all of their contents. HTML benefits the most from 2-space indentation.
- In Vue single-file components, indent one level inside the `<template>` tag, but not in the `<script>` or `<style>` tags.

    **Yes:**
    ```
    <template>
        <div>...</div>
    </template>

    <script lang="ts">
    @Component
    class MyComponent { ... }
    </script>

    <style scoped lang="scss">
    .my-class { ... }
    </style>
    ```

    **No:**
    ```
    <template>
        <div>...</div>
    </template>

    <script lang="ts">
        @Component
        class MyComponent { ... }
    </script>

    <style scoped lang="scss">
        .my-class { ... }
    </style>
    ```

## Braces
- Use Java-style curly braces. (Opening braces are on the same line as the class/function/loop/conditional/try-catch they start, closing braces are on their own line):
    ```
    class Spam {

    }

    function egg() {

    }

    if (true) {

    }
    else {

    }

    while (true) {

    }
    ```
    - Note: eslint and tslint-eslint-rules incorrectly refer to this brace style as "Stroustroup".
## Line Length
Lines of code should be no longer than 100 characters.

## Names
- Use `PascalCase` for class, enum, and type names.
    ```
    class SpamEgg {}
    type MyAlias = SpamEgg;
    enum AnEnum {
        val_one = 'val_one',
        val_two = 'val_two
    }
    ```
- Use `snake_case` for variable, function, method, and file names.
- In HTML/CSS, use `skewer-case` for class and id names.
- In Vue templates, use `snake_case` for `ref=xxx` and `data-testid=xxx` attributes.
- In Vue templates, use the `skewer-case` variant of component names, unless doing so would cause consecutive capital letters from being broken up (e.g. use `APIErrors` instead of the default `a-p-i-errors`).
- Do not start Vue prop or data member names with a leading underscore. Vue reserves these names for its implementation, and collisions can cause bugs that are hard to diagnose.
- Start all Vue "data" members (declared as default-initialized member variables in Typescript component classes) with a leading "d_".
    - These members that start with "d_" should only be accessed by the component itself and the test cases for that specific component. If possible, add a property getter and make the data member private.
    ```
    @Component
    class MyComponent {
        // Input to the component
        @Prop({default: True, type: Boolean})
        is_on!: boolean;

        // Use this in the component and test cases (we have an input
        // called is_on, so we can't add a property getter).
        d_is_on = false;

        // Since there's no input with this name, we can use a property
        // getter.
        get gettable_property() {
            return this.d_gettable_property;
        }

        // Since we have a property getter, we can make this private.
        private d_gettable_property: string = '';
    }
    ```
    - If you're writing a component to use **only** for testing (and the component is defined in the same file as the test cases), you may ignore this convention.
    - Rejected alternatives:
        - Leading underscore: Vue reserves names starting with a leading "_" for its implementation.
        - $data.\<member_name\>: Accessing data members through $data loses type information.
        - Trailing underscore: A single trailing underscore is to easy to miss visually.
- Use UPPER_CASE for global constants or static readonly class variables.
```
const MY_CONST = 42;
class Spam {
    static readonly CLASS_VAR = 43;
}
```
- When an imported function, class, enum, etc. needs to be made available to a component
    template, add a readonly variable with the same name to the class.
```
import { MyEnum, my_func } from 'utils';
@Component
class MyComponent {
    readonly MyEnum = MyEnum;
    readonly my_func = my_func;
}
```

## Line Breaks
- When wrapping a line at an operator, break _before_ the operator:
```
// Yes
if (spamspamspamspamspam
    && egg) {
    ...
}

// No
if (spamspamspamspamspam &&
    egg) {
    ...
}
```
- If the first statement of an `if` block is indented to the same level as the wrapped condition, indent the wrapped condition an extra level.
    - Note: This is only an issue in files where indentation is 4 spaces.
```
if (spamspamspamspamspam
        && egg) {
    do_something();
}
```
- When wrapping a chained function call, prefer to break after the opening parenthesis, placing the closing parenthesis on a new line after the function arguments:
```
// Yes
function_one(
    arg1, arg2
).function_two();

// Avoid
function_one(arg1, arg2)
    .function_two();
```
- When a closing brace, bracket, or parenthesis is on its own line, align
it with the first character of the line that starts the multiline construct:
```
let my_list = [
    'spam',
    'egg',
    'waluigi,
];
```
## Imports
- In imports, you may use `./` to import from a module in the same directory as the current one.
- You may use `../` relative imports for __one level only__. If a relative import would require `../../` or more, then use an absolude import instead.
- To use an absolute import of a module in the `src` folder, begin the import with `@` (this should be configured in the project's tsconfig.json file):
```
// There is a mapping defined in tsconfig.json so that we can say
// "@" instead of "src".
import { spam } from "@/my/module";
```
- Similarly, absolute imports in the `test` folder should begin with `@/tests`:
```
// "@/tests" is mapped to "tests" in tsconfig.json.
import { egg } from "@/tests/utils";
```

- Group imports in the following order (TSLint should be configured to enforce these rules):
    - Vue libraries whose paths start with 'vue'
    - Vue libraries whose paths start with '@vue'
    - 3rd-party libraries
    - Imports from this project
    - Imports from this project's `@/test` directory.
    - Parent directory relative imports
    - Current directory relative imports.
- Separate each group with a blank line.
